# warningstripes
This is a Python script that builds recent RCP pathway warning stripes using data from Berkeley Earth. Inspired by the work of Alexander Radtke (https://x.com/alxrdk), see https://rateofchange.substack.com/p/the-rate-of-change.

Feel free to modify it. Unfortunately, I was unable to achieve the same scissor split as he did in the graphics.
